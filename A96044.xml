            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Scriptures are full of these comfortable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, which are as so many. Pillars to support the Righteous Church and People of God from fink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Troubles of this present World; many are and have been the Plots and Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions raised by the Malice of wicked Men against them, and yet as often have been delivered; yet sometimes God suffers those Instruments of Cruelty to go on in their Designs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his People are brought to the brink of Ruine, and then in a moment he turns the stream of Destruction upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof, while he preserveth his People by his Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power.</p>
            <p>What a desperate pinch were we brought to this Fifth day of <hi>November:</hi> Now we were in the Fire indeed, a Fire kindled in Hell, a Sulphurean Fire, into which, not only the three Children, but the three 'States of our Realm were enwrapped, and all bound together, to have perished with one Crack. Let us pause here, and consider the danger of our Extremities, that we may be stirred up the more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153709:3"/>and heartily, to magnifie the Mercy, Power, and Goodness of the Lord, manifested in our Delivery: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how cunningly it was contrived, how cruelly it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, how nearly atchieved, how miraculously discovered, for the cunning in contriving, what secrecy of Care, what secrecy of Persons, the place, a place of Darkness, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit for a work of Darkness, the secrecy of the place seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to invite them to this bloudy Design, even as the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of time smiled upon them, and promised to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Midwise, to deliver the Actors (who big with their Conception) of this monstrous Burthen: Let me now take you hand in hand, and lead you to this dark Cave, this hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Den, this fiery <hi>Aetna,</hi> this tormenting <hi>Tophet,</hi> I know not what to call it, Grammar, Logick, Rhetorick, all are posed, no Art can yield a work Emphatical enough for this artificial Phalarian Invention, a strange Engine, it was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the torment of Innocents, but (as that of <hi>Phaleris</hi>) turned to the torment of the Inventors. See here what Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Powder packed close together! what piles of Wood billetted over those Barrels! what Barrels of Iron mingled with those Piles! Of all resemblances, methinks a <hi>Tophet</hi> sits it best, see the description of <hi>Tophet,</hi> and parallel them, <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 33.33. Tophet <hi>is ordained of old, yea, for the King it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the Pile thereof is Fire and much Wood, the Breath of the Lord like a stream of Brimstone doth kindle it.</hi> Lo here a right Tophet ordained of old, hatched in the latter years of the Reign of our late Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> prepared not by God, but by Men; nay; not by Men; but by Devils, was it not dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged deep, and made large, made for the King, yea, and the Queen, Prince, Prelates, Lords, Commons, all the burning of it was Fire and much Wood, a stream of Power, as a River of Brimstone, was to kindle it, a right <hi>Tophet;</hi> some place Hell in the Centre or midst of the Earth; here you might have found it somewhat beneath the superficies of the Earth: thus were there Villanies buried in the Bowels of the Earth, <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 29.15. <hi>They dig deep to hide their Counsel from God and Man;</hi> the Persons will be as secret as the Place.</p>

            <p> These Catholick Conspirators, to make all sure, to sow their Lips fast, swear a Silence, and bind that Oath with the Sacrament, and did what in them lay, as far as God would give them leave; but let no Man henceforth wonder at the Fury of that Romish <hi>Catiline,</hi> who forced his Followers to pledge each other in Healths of humane Bloud. Behold here that Romish <hi>Catesby,</hi> with his 'Complices, take the Bloud of God, and as they maintain it, the real essential Bloud of the Son of God must be caroused, to give up their Lips from the Discovery of this Hellish Design! thus closely was it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, so lapped in the Mantle of Darkness that none but the Devil, as they gave it out (the Lord was far from their thoughts) could unvail it, and pluck off the Mask from this Hag; yet was their Cruelties no whit inferiour to their Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: Let me begin in the VVords of <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 4.32. <hi>Ask of the Days of old, that have been since God created Man upon the Earth, from one end of Heaven unto the other, if there came to pass such a great thing as this, or ever the like was heard of;</hi> search all Chronicle, turn over the Records of all Nations, no Age, nor Story, Humane or Divine, can match this match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Bresident, the Massacre of <hi>France,</hi> the Slaughter of the <hi>Indies,</hi> wherein Worlds of People were most cruelly made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, all heinous transcendent Crimes falls short of this. <hi>Nero</hi> that Spring of Bloud, and Monster of Men, as the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Record, wished all the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had but one Head, that he might chop it off at a Blow; that which was but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired of <hi>Nero</hi> was not wished only, but plotted and attempted by these Antichristian <hi>Nero</hi>'s; had their Plot taken effect, not the Head of <hi>Rome</hi> but of <hi>England</hi> had been cut off at a Blow. <hi>Nero</hi> caused the City of <hi>Rome</hi> to be fired, and laid the blame on the Christians; if their Train had blown up our Church and State, the Imputation of so foul a Fact by these Equivocating Catholicks, must have been cast on our innocent Protestant Brethren. These famous Kingdoms, by a blessed Peace-maker, our late Soveraign King <hi>James</hi> the First, united into one happy Monarchy, had been with one Blow and Blast in a day, an hour, a moment, perished, e'er they knew who hurt them; no Sect, no Sex, no Person, nor Age might be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153709:4"/>spared, no, not those of their own Religion; the Powder, like the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi>'s Sword, would have known no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Protestant and Papist; the King's Majesty, the Golden Head of this Land, the Lord's Anointed, and the Breath of our Nostrils, his dear Queen; his Princely Heir, the Pledge of our succeeding Hopes; the noble Lords and Barons, the Shields and Shoulders of our Land; the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Bishops and Clergy, the Chariots and Horse-men of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi> the grave Sages and Judges, the Hands of our Land for Execution of Justice; the Flower of our Gentry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the Feet of this Land; root and branch, priest and people, head, root, branches, eyes, shoulders, arms, hands, feet, all, all, should have been torn up, and mounted on high to fall headlong; their Carcasses mangled and burnt, by an unheard of kind of Execution; in their Wrath they digged down a VVall, and in their Anger would take away a whole Nation as one Man. <hi>Cursed be their Anger, for it was fierce and their Wrath, for it was cruel; into their Secrets let not the Righteous enter: My Soul be not thou joined with their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;</hi> How near was it come, even to the point of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution! the Children were at the Birth; we had but the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Match to live; not a hair's breadth between us and this Death, these Flames. How miraculously was this Plot discovered! How opportunely were the Traytors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Wisdom of the King came from the Inspiration of the Almighty; strange it is to consider what English his Majesty did pick out of a dark Letter; he that sits in Heaven made their own Hands and Pens to betray all, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Curse not the King, no, not in thy thoughts; for the Fowls of the Heaven shall carry it, and that which hath Wings shall declare the matter.</hi> If the Lord had not been with us, among us, for us, and put a VVord of Divination into the Lips of our gracious Soveraign, we had all been, long e'er this, as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> Kings, Princes, Nobles, Peers, Prelates, Judges, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Commons, our Peace, Plenty, the Gospel of Peace, the Comfort of our Lives, and the Life of all our Comforts, al<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, As an Almighty powerfull Saviour; Is there any thing too hard for him? Is his Arm shortned? Did not he wound <hi>Rahab?</hi> Smite the Dragon? Overthrow the Horse, and his Rider? make a Path in the great VVaters, and allay the heat of the Fire? he works with means, without means, against means, and doth whatever he will in Heaven or Earth: Hath not he set bounds to the Sea, though it rage and foam, here it must stay, thus far it shall come and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; here the proud VVaves must be broken. Hath not he Satan in a Chain, and all his Instruments, that they cannot pluck a hair from the head of his Servants without his leave and licence? Behold now the safety, the security of the Church! If God be with us who shall be against us? if God

Witness this Day of days, on the Morning of our Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> they would have blown us up; on the Evening of their Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> God beat them down.</p>

            <p> Is <hi>Jehovah</hi> the deliverer of his Israel?

            <p>Finally, doth the security of the Church, State, all lie in the presence of God? Where God is, there is no Danger; as where he is not, no safety; O keep him while we have him, drive him not from you who is our Buckler, our Shield, all in all unto us, keep him in his Word, in his Sabbaths, in his Ordinances, and he will keep you. Would you know in a word, what drives the Lord from a Land, a People? Sin; nothing but Sin can do it, and Sin will do it, <hi>Your sins have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated between me and you;</hi> where Sin is countenanced, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, multiplied, there is no harbour for the Almighty. <hi>He is a God of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, what communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Belial, light and darkness, Christ and Antichrist?</hi> Sin chases the Lord away, and leaves that person, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naked, unfeigned, exposed to the Malice of Men, to the Fury of Satan, to the Flames of Hell. Every wilfull Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is a Traytor to God, his King, and Countrey, as well as to his own Soul. Away with beloved darling Sins, away with those wasting King-killing State-ruinated Sins, Idolatry, Contempt of God's Word, Worship, Sacraments, Sabbath, Ministers, Scandalous enormous Impieties, out-facing Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: These if they should be found among us, will kindle a Flame in our Cities, Countrey, a worse then Powder-Flame, that shall burn to the bottom of Hell.</p>
            <p>If we our selves betray not our Souls, our Church, our State, our Kingdom, in vain shall the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> repine at the prosperity of <hi>England;</hi> if we pull not down our own Walls with our own hands, no Engines of theirs shall ever batter them; if we do not open the sluces and floud-gates, the Inundations of that <hi>Romish Nilus,</hi> with her marish Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, shall never over flow our Banks; if we carry not Flax, Tinder, Gun-Powers, in our own bosomes, and strike not Fire with our own fingers, their Matches shall never take, their sparkles shall not burn, the flame shall not kindle upon us.</p>

            <p>O Almighty God, great in Mercy, and wonderful in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who by the instinct of Nature, and charge on holy Scripture, hast taught us, that great Del verances ought to have perpetual remembrances: We miserable Sinners, whose corrupt Nature and vile Actions have deserved by evtraordinary Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be made a spectacle to the World, and to Angels, and to Men, do humbly acknowledge thy Love and long Sufferance, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering us from many heavy Judgments which might justly have been brought upon us and our chiefest Delights.</p>
            <p>O Lord, we tremble to think upon it, how unjustly they intended to take us away before our time, by secret conveying of fearful Gun-Powder covered with Iron, Wood and Coals. ready to put Fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a dark Vault under the House of Parliament, a place of state against a present sitting.</p>
            <p>O Lord, if this had not been, we had been blown up, we had been smothered, we had been dismembred, we had been persecuted: We had been undone, all and some, fearing thy Name, the poor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, the worthy Gentry, the judicious Lawyer, the reverend Judge, the true Nobility, the Learned Clergy, and the sacred Council of our King; yea, our King and his Queen, and all the Royal Progency, the most honourable Assembly of <hi>Christendom</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their State, for the continuance of they Truth and good of the Realm.</p>
